MoneyBox Tech Challenge

A small app allowing a user to browse through their Moneybox accounts and add a fixed amount of money to each one.

Getting Started

After cloning this app through github, navigate to the working directory of the app, please install the correct libraries and frameworks using "gem install cocoapods" and "pod install" through the command line.

This app runs through the "MoneyBox_App.xcworkspace: file" with the XCode simulator. Press play to run.

Improvements

Due to time restraints this app does not include many functiions that I would have liked. This is my first time using API's with Swift/XCode so it has been a thoroughly educational experience. If I where to continue with this project I would like to include the following:

- Unit/Integration Tests

- Logos of the company

- More display fields/information about the users account, including "Total Contributions" & "Maximum deposit".

I would have liked for there to be only one viewController which would show the accounts details. I currently have two viewController which isn't allowing for completely DRY code.

Error handling also needs to be fully implemented throughout the entirety of the app.

As previously mentioned this is my first using an API like this, so next time I would like to have "dry" er code, especially in the APIServices.swift file.
