## MoneyBox Tech Challenge ## 


A small app allowing a user to browse through their Moneybox accounts and add a fixed amount of money to each one.

 ### Requirements ###
 
- Xcode 9 or higher
- Cocoa pods Gem
- Git

### Setup ###

- `git clone https://github.com/Rb2030/MoneyBox.git`
- `cd MoneyBox`
- `pod install`
- `open MoneyBox_App.xcworkspace`
- press play after Xcode opens


### Improvements ### 

This was my first time using API's with Swift/XCode so it has been a thoroughly educational experience. If I were to continue with this project I would like to include the following:

- Unit/Integration Tests

- A logout button

- More UILabels/information about the users account, including "Total Contributions" & "Maximum deposit".

- Refactor `GeneralInvestmentViewController.swift` and `StocksAndSharesViewController.swift` into one viewcontroller

- Add error handling using Alert Views

- Refactor `APIService.swift`

- Add email and password validation on the `InitialViewController.swift` text fields
